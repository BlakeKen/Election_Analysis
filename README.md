## Summary statement 

Although this script could be used ofr any election, some modifications would have to be made. The csv file would need to be switched to the next one chosen and then we switch the file paths, double check we are calling the right indexs(since files differ) and we would be good to go! If we canted to go by state vs by county for a bigger election we could even updated the dictionaries and variables to do so. 

Another  analysis that could be done is counting each candidates vote by county but that would come with more modifications.
